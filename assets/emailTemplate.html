        <h3>Dear HR Team,</h3>
        <p>I hope this message finds you well. My name is <span class="strong-text">Divyanshu Singh</span>, currently a Computer Science Engineering student in my 5th semester at Chandigarh University. I am writing to express my interest in the full-stack web development internship at <span class="strong-text">StandInCrowd</span>.</p>
        
        <p>I have hands-on experience in full-stack development, having worked on several projects such as a <span class="strong-text">Camp-Finder web application</span> built using the MERN stack, where users can perform CRUD operations to manage campgrounds with a user-friendly design. Additionally, I developed a <span class="strong-text">Face Recognition-Based Attendance System</span> using Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter, and an <span class="strong-text">Avalanche Prediction Model</span> leveraging machine learning techniques.</p>
        
        <p>I also had the opportunity to intern at <span class="strong-text">Prodigy InfoTech</span>, contributing to both front-end and back-end development, and debugging web applications to ensure performance optimization.</p>
        
        <p>You can find more details about my projects and technical skills on my portfolio website: <a href="https://dev-divyanshu.netlify.app" class="strong-text">dev-divyanshu.netlify.app</a>.</p>
        
        <p>As I am currently pursuing my degree, I may not be able to work on-site during the weekdays until after 5 PM, but I would be happy to visit your office on Saturdays and Sundays if that works for you.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the possibility of contributing to your team and look forward to the opportunity to discuss this further.</p>
        
        <p class="italic-text">Best regards,<br>
        Divyanshu Singh<br>
